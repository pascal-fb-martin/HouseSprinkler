 * SYNOPSYS:
 *
 * void housesprinkler_season_refresh (void);
 *
 *    This function must be called each time the sprinkler configuration
 *    has been changed. It converts the configured seasons into activable
 *    ones.
 *
 * int housesprinkler_season_priority (const char *name);
 *
 *    Return the priority of the specified season. or 0 if the season does
 *    not exist.
 *
 * int housesprinkler_season_index (const char *name);
 *
 *    Return the current watering index given the specific season setting,
 *    or 100 (full watering) if the season does not exist.
